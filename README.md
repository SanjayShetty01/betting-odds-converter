## About

The Betting Odds Calculator is a Scala project that allows users to easily convert different types of betting odds into implied probabilities. It provides valuable insights for bettors, helping them make informed decisions based on market odds.

## Supported Betting Odds

The application supports three widely used types of betting odds:

1. **American Moneyline:**
   - Denoted by an integer number.
   - A positive American Moneyline indicates the potential profit when wagering $100.
   - A negative American Moneyline indicates the amount needed to wager to win $100.

2. **Decimals:**
   - Decimal odds quote the potential returns that would be paid if the bet succeeds in your favor.

3. **Fractions:**
   - Fractional odds, like decimal odds, quote the potential returns if the bet succeeds.
   - Presented in a fractional format.
