## Odds in betting. 

There are three most widely used odds in most betting sites worldwide. They are,
1.  Amercian Moneyline.
2.  Decimals.
3.  Fractions.

### American Moneyline:
American Moneyline would be denoted by a integer number. The American Moneyline, if positive number states the amount you would win if you wager $100. But if it's negative, then it would state the amount you would require wager to win $100. 

### Decimals:
The decimal odds quote the potential returns that would be paid if the bet succeeds in your favour.

### Fractions:
Like the decimal odds, the fractional bet also quote the potential returns that  would be paid if the bet succeeds in your favour. Albeit in a fractional format.
